## Description

_Duration: 10 Day Sprint_

On a regular basis I find myself talking to friends and family about this cool new project I'm working on or they tell me about how far along their garden has come over the last two years.
Then we spend the next 20 mins awkwardly sending photos back and forth via text or email or try to describe the growth of the project over the course of time but feeling like itâ€™s not really getting the idea across.
That's why I created Zoetrope Gallery.
