        On a regular basis I find myself talking to friends and family about
        this cool new project I'm working on or they tell me about how far along
        their garden has come over the last two years. Then we spend the next 20
        mins awkwardly sending photos back and forth via text or email or try to
        describe the growth of the project over the course of time but feeling
        like itâ€™s not really getting the idea across. That's why I created
        Zoetrope Gallery.
